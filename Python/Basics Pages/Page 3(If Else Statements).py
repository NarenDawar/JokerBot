#if else statements are used to assign rules to a value. They create multiple pathways given a value(s).
#if else statements. You can place an if/else statement into another if/else statement. However, there is a better alternative.
#You can type 'elif' which adds another condition. The sign '=' can only be used as an assignment. (Ex. a=2)
#If you want to use '=' as a condition, you must use two equal signs. 
#Ex: if a = b, print("Hi") WRONG
#Ex: if a==b, print ("Hi") RIGHT

#Colon represents the index. YOU MUST PUT A COLON AFTER A FUNCTION OR IF/ELSE STATEMENT AS SEEN ABOVE
